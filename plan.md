# Menu Option Ideas

## Rotating Menu

The user uses three or more fingers to roatate left or right to open the menu. From there, they can continue to rotate to access
different menu items, much like a dial. They can click on an icon to access submenus.

## Pinching Menu

The user uses two fingers to pinch in to open the menu. The menu will pop up around their fingers and from there, they can
swipe up, down, left, or right to access submenus.

## Sidebar Menu

The menu is always available along the left/right side of the canvas with the icons always visible. The user can click on an icon
to access submenus.
